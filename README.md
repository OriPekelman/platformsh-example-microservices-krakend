# Platform.sh MicroServices Example with a KrakenD gateway a Vault instance and a Keycloack instance

This example is for learning purposes only and is not intended as a starting point for an actual production instance. 

In `.platform/applications.yaml`: 

* We have a single React app as a front end accessible at the apex.
* We have one API gateway written in nodejs that can proxy the other micro-services
* We have 4 microservices, one in Go, one in Java, one in Python and one in NodeJS
* a Keycloak instance
* a Vault instance (depending on your usage pattern - we also have vault as a managed service when used as a KMS)
* And we have added two worker instances - one in Python and one in Go - these do nothing actually (their start command is simply `sleep`) - but they show more topological options
* For added realism we also introduce a network storage instance accessible by the Python and Golang apps and workers

Apps: frontend, golang-service, java-service, keycloack, nodejs-service, nodejs-service-gateway, python-service, vault, python_queue_handler, go_queue_handler

## Notes:

* The configuration of the internal routing of the gateway is in `krakend/krakend.json` but again, this is just a toy. In real life our Router has enough functionality to actually replace it.
* We have sprinkled some relationships between apps and services so it could be demosntrated that inter-service routing is opt-in.
* In this example we put everything in a single Yaml file. But there are other options such as putting a `.platform.app.yaml` in the root of each app. 

In `.platform/services.yaml`: 

There are two databases: One a postgres to serve the microservices (as an example it is configured with two different schemas - and three "endpoints" or roles - admin, reporter and importer), and one MariaDB for Keycloack.

Services: dbpostgres, keycloack-database

And in `.platform/routes.yaml`: 

We expose public routes for the Frontend, the API gateway as well as for Vault and Keycloack.
Routes: "https://{default}/", "https://api.{default}/", "https://keycloack.{default}", "https://vault.{default}/"
